this application is meant to simulate what an investement banker will do to create a comps analysis, we use a fundamentalist approach (not pure comparables).
1. by fetching certain charastiristics for the target firm (inputted by the user) we decide how our sample will look like
2. fetch all financial data needed for our fundamental comps analysis
3. project financials for all firms (including target company)
4. use firm & equity multiple engines to come up with multiples
5. store in db & filter out edge cases
6. provide extra data (statistical analysis, volatility analysis, complementary data).
